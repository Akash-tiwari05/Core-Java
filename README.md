## Introduction

As a student of Java, I am focusing on mastering the foundational concepts that will help me build robust applications. This repository serves as a collection of my notes, code snippets, and projects related to Core Java.

## Core Java Concepts

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications. Key concepts include:

- **Classes and Objects:** The blueprint of objects; classes define the properties and behaviors.
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (class).
- **Inheritance:** Mechanism to create new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reuse.
- **Polymorphism:** Ability to perform a single action in different ways; includes method overloading and overriding.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

### Strings in Java

Strings in Java are a sequence of characters and are essential for handling text data. Key points include:

- **String Class:** Immutable class that represents character strings.
- **Common Methods:**
  - `length()`: Returns the length of the string.
  - `charAt(int index)`: Returns the character at the specified index.
  - `substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)`: Returns a new string that is a substring of the original.
  - `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()`: Converts the string to lower or upper case.
  - `trim()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
